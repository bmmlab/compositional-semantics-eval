'embeddings' means these were produced by taking PCA of the relevant embedding model.
'verbnet' means these are produced using verbnet parsing.
'aug' refers to whether the PCA components or Verbnet semantic role similarities were augmented by the overall similarity computed by a particular embedding method.
